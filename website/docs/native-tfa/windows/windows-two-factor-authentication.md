## FAQ

### What happens if agent could not resolve TRASA server?

When user tries to login to windows protected with TRASA TFA agent, agent will contact TRASA server for 2FA verification.

_What happens when agent cannot contact TRASA server?_

In case that you have a network problem, and the agent cannot resolve TRASA server address, your access will be blocked. To overcome this situation, TRASA allows you to set an emergency access account or offline user.

Offline user account can be any currently being used user account in your windows logon (domain or local account). Do note that the username must be exactly matched to the existing user account.

:::tip
If the user is local account, but windows is domain joined, you will need to assign full user path in format
`local-workgroup-name\username`
