## Create Web service profile in TRASA and map user access

Configuring HTTP (web) service is a bit different from SSH or RDP.

1. First, you will need to configure DNS to point web traffic to the TRASA server.
2. Then, configure proxy detail in the TRASA dashboard to forward incoming web traffic to the upstream web application.

:::important
In the video guide below, we only show how to configure HTTP service in TRASA. For a fully working setup, you will need to configure a DNS record that points to the TRASA server.
