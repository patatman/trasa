This tutorial series only covers the basic scenario and shows one of many ways TRASA can protect internal access to your services.

But TRASA is a unified access control platform, meaning it offers many access control features to protect your teams and services. Below we list some other features which TRASA supports.

### SSH certificate auth

You can use TRASA to setup [SSH certificate authentication.](../services/ssh/ssh.md#ssh-certificates)

### Secure credential storage, single sign on

You can use TRASA to store credentials in [credentials (password and keys) vault](../providers/vault/tsxvault.md) so that you need not share a password with your teams or 3rd party support team.

### Radius authentication

Protect access to hardware devices (firewall, router, switch) with TRASA [radius server authentication](../services/radius/radius.md)

### Native two factor authetnication

Native [two factor authentication](../native-tfa/index.md) agent to protect windows and linux OS.

### Adhoc access policy

Implement maker checker type policy to make every access go through [mandatory access review.](../policies/adhoc.md)

### Integrations

Integrate with external [identity providers](../providers/providers.md) to import user's identity
