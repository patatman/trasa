We've configured service profile and access routes in [Part 4](./protect-services.md) or this tutorial.

Now, we will test access to services.

:::important

In TRASA,

- SSH service can be accessed from both dashboard (no external client required) or any ssh clients (PuTTY, Bitvise, OpenSSH client).
- RDP services are only accessible from the dashboard. i.e. does not support RDP from other clients.
- Https service can only be accessed from the browser and only if the TRASA browser extension is installed in the browser.

## Viewing available service access

You can view available services that can be accessed from [My Page](../getting-started/glossary.md#my-route). Every service that is assigned to you will be listed on that page.

Below is a screenshot of available access applications and services for the Nepsec administrator.
