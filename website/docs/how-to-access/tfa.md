Second Step Verification, or two-factor authentication, is an essential feature provided by TRASA. Almost anything you access in TRASA or access via TRASA proxy will require second step verification (unless otherwise explicitly removed by policy).



## Verification using TRASA mobile app


When you try to login using TRASA, you will be asked to choose a second step verification method.
